## Progress:
The progress made this week consisted of the following:
- Added docstrings to every function in the program and proper comments, while I still remember how everything works!
- Added bubbleSort algorithmn to lstMovesValue in mainMenuForm, sorts moves alphabetically by their labels.
- Started work on flowcharts and psuedocode in dia (did 4)
- Implemented btnPlayGame for linux using os.system and os.path.dirname
An interesting tidbit is that the way i originally designed the text game is you pass to it the directory containing your world file rather than the file itself: this is useful because now it prevents the user from performing a shell injection attack

## Problems
Found an error wherein selecting an empty dmgtype in editEnemy or editItem would crash the program:
- Resolved by adding an if statement to convert empty dmgtype enemy value to None, as it is represented in the json

Found an error where the program would crash if one tries to save a tile onto it when no file has been selected/created:
- Resolved by adding an error message if the user attempts to save a tile before opening/creating a world file.

Found an unneccessary error message appearing when the user cancels the file dialog in introForm:
- Resolved by adding to the if clauses in the intro form so the user doesn't get an error message if they don't select a file (ie. cancelled the file dialog)

Found issue whereby tblWorldMap and game\_world wouldn't reset and reload after opening a new form from a preexisting one.
- Resolved by adding `self.game\_world = {}` in actionOpenNewFile subroutine and loadWorldFile() in introForm.

- Slightly modified Text\_Game to fix how it iterates possible questlines: now skips directories in scandir and checks to be a json file.
- Was unable to implement btnPlayGame for Windows despite fixing one issue: I assumed os.path would use the different directory slash separator. Now I need to figure out how to open new windows terminals with os.system().

## Design Refinements
- Decided to limit scope of the project to disinclude git integration, since the user can simply do this this manually in a terminal if they wish. Not to mention they'd probably find that way easier.
- Removed frivolous search bar from mainMenu that had not been given any functionality.

## Learning
- Learnt about cross-platform methods of executing commands across Linux and Windows, with the subprocess library and the os library.
