## Progress:
This week I've been working on the Social and Ethical Issues section and its overview, following the task document and its specification for discussing intellectual property, quality, inclusivity, privacy, and ergonomics.

## Problems
It was difficult to write about some of the topics like inclusivity, privacy and ergonomics, since despite their being part of the NESA curriculumn they seem largely irrelevant to my project. Privacy would seem it be more relevant in reference to an application which has some form of a back-end database that registers and stores data from users; while inclusivity and ergonomics seem somewhat alien concepts to me in regards to developing software. This makes sense though, since desktop applications are meant to be designed for 'user friendliness'.

## Learning
I've been doing some reading on the concepts behind social and ethical issues in software development this week. I found [this document](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/not-ipr.html) particularly helpful interesting, as it certainly posits a radical stance compared to most modern opinions about intellectual property today. The stance taken by the author does seem to hold some validity, however I don't believe NESA would give me marks if I were to put forth the author's opinion in the Social and Ethical Issues component of the SDD exam.
