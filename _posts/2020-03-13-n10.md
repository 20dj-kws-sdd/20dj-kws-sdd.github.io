## Progress:
During this week we covered the theory content of multidimensional arrays, which I suspect may be useful in the future implementation of my project which will prominently feature a large 2D grid. I started putting real progress towards my currently-undecided method of publishing blogs. Unfortunately I spend a fair chunk of the week at home due to illness, therefore little other progress was made.
## Problems
One of the things I want to get away from most during this project is Blogger. Frankly, its interface was always a chore to use, especially the uploading of images; and I've long held the notion in my mind that I'll eventually create a website on the open web. I'm looking at multiple options, such as self-hosting a site on my homeserver or using GitHub pages; but underlying this I believe I'll use a static site generator like Jekyll or Hugo to generate html out of markdown files. I've made this decision because markdown is beautifully simple to format and edit, and using a big messy program like a static site generator sounds like a fair bit of fun.
## Learning
Learned about static-site generator systems for blog-website manufacturing, such as Jekyll or Hugo. Both are open-source and give large degrees of freedom regarding styles and customisation and look quite appealing compared to Google's alternative.

## Screenshots
This is the format template I'm using for my markdown blog posts (including this one), which I currently all have saved to disk until I determine a hosting solution.
