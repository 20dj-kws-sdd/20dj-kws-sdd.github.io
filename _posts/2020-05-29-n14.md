## Progress:
It begins! This week marked the beginning of my actual implementation of tbrpgepp. Overall I managed to figure out that I would need to use a graphical UI designer (qtcreator) to create the look of each form, and then import those UI files into the Python program to add functionality to them. So far, I have created a very basic introForm UI file and introForm Python program.

## Problems
Earlier in the week, before I realized I would have to use the UI file import method, I was very conflicted as to whether the program swould *start* either by opening the mainMenu form which would then open a file dialog to open/create the game-world file, or whether an introForm would be used instead. Eventually I settled on the introForm option.

## Learning
I very quickly learnt this week that manually adding UI elements and effectively modifying their layout would be an abysmally time-consuming process. I learnt about UI files from this resource: https://www.learnpyqt.com/courses/qt-creator/first-steps-qt-creator/ and determined that this was the far more efficient option.

You can inevitably see how painful it would be to add and arrange every component of the UI in code by hand.

Much easier.
