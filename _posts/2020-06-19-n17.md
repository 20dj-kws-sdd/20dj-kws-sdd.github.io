## Progress:
This week I created UI files for editEnemy, editItem, and editMoves forms. I updated UI files for editTile, introForm and mainMenu. I also added to sidebar in the mainMenu a listbox for displaying moves. I also started adding logic to determine whether to open item or enemy form depending on the tile type value in editMovesForm's combobox, including greying out the add element button before combobox item is selected.

## Problems
Essentially, I've resolved last week's isssue of having different editTile forms for different room types by making "Edit Tile" only open **one** type of form (editTileForm), which then has a greyed-out "Edit Element" button that changes its function depending on what tile type the user has selected in the combobox. Additionally, I also wasn't sure how to incorporate the moves dict property into the Edit Tiles form as I had originally anticipated, since the relevant input fields and controls would be too large overall to fit on the editTile form; so I created another form (editMovesForm) and a button to open it in editTileForm.

## Design Refinements
I created a seperate form for editing a tile's move dict (editMoveForm) since the relevant fields would not fit on the editTileForm.

I also created seperate forms for editing a tile's enemy or item.
