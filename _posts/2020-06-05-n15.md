## Progress:
This week, I significantly built up the UI for mainMenu and introForm. I landed on a 1280x720 layout as a good middle ground for desktop applications, as the widgets weren't made to appear too small.

## Problems
I had lots of trouble using qtcreator, especially when setting layouts. For example, for some reason one form's central widget was somehow permanently set to a vertical layout while an otherwise identical form wasn't. This eventually was resolved by using the 'break layout' button

I had an issue with creating the game-world grid table within 'scrollarea' for the main form, where the scroll bars were not appearing. This was resolved by deleting 'scrollarea' and enabling scroll bars on the individual table widget.

## Learning
Learnt a method of opening file dialogs for PyQt5 from http://zetcode.com/gui/pyqt5/dialogs/ , used in introForm to create the "open file" dialog.
