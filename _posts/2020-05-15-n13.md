## Progress:
Since returning to school a week ago from the throes of isolation I have been solely and ardently studying the PyQt5 cross-platform Desktop framework. This hurried fervour was acquired after I returned to school and achieved an acutely painful realization: namely, that I had absolutely no clue how to create a desktop application outside of Visual Basic.

In the last week I've created three small desktop programs that make good use of the principles of PyQt5 (connections, layouts, slots), which I learnt how to create from an ebook on PyQt5 (https://gumroad.com/l/pysqtsamples).

## Problems
True fans of tbrpggepp know that ever since 2019 I've had in my posession an ebook relating to PyQt: unfortunately, that book was for PyQt4 instead of PyQt5; this introduced numerous incongruent differences which I became acutely aware of after attempting to implement the examples in the book. For example, connections are handled in a particularly messy manner in PyQt4 which is made significantly more elegant in its predecessor. The names of classes are different between the two library versions, etc.

# Learning
In the last two weeks I've essentially learnt a desktop framework from scratch. I know how to create and execute forms, create functionality in UI elements, and link forms together in a program. I feel somewhat prepared for beginning to create the major project itself.
