## Progress

Throughout the holidays, I made the following progress:
- Added call to delChildForms subroutine to cancel button on editTile form
- Essentially completed building of UI files
- Made table font bold for easier reading
- Completed feature of loading data into program and input fields.

- Implemented code in editMoves form
-  Created "propogateChange()" method in tile edit form such that changes made in the child forms can be "propogated" back to the parent and eventually to the main form

- Refactored saving sustem for tiles. Instead of each child form independently editing the wider game\_world the child forms instead complete their respective components of the dictionary and send it back to the tile editing form. The tile editing form then compiles these changes and edits them into its copy of the game\_world, then calls the mainMenu form to assimilate this game\_world and write it to disk.
- Refactored further such that the editTile form only edits the value of the individual tile entry and sends that back to an updateTile() method in the main menu
- Added file saving and creation of new files in introForm
- Changed tileClicked method such that coords showed up even when clicking on empty tiles and the coords appeared in the editTile form

In this state the program is perfectly usable with manual use of git and the text game. Next step is to integrate the two into the application.

## Problems
The problems and solutions I encountered during the holidays are as follows:

- Encountered numerous issues in implementing such as info labels not updating due to forgetting you had to use setText() method, many other trivial issues

- Issue with opening edit tile form and passing tile object to class constructor, interpreter says passing too many arguments
- - Issue resolved after much time by realizing I was accidently editing the item edit form, not the tile edit form.

- Encountered an issue where changes would persist in the overall game world even if forms had the cancel (instead of the 'save') button clicked. Realized this was because of how Python handles references and the creation of new variables assigned preexisting variable values. Resolved by going into the init subroutine of each child form and replacing ```self.game_world = game_world``` with ```self.game_world = copy.deepcopy(game_world)``` which resolved the issue completely.

- Issue saving tiles, change not appearing on world map
- - Added a loop to remove tiles which overlap coordinates xor names with new ones, since tile names are used as keyID's instead of coordinates (dumb mistake I made 2 years ago)
- - *May* have just been forgetting to update tile\_name with data from the object.

- Fixed an issue where tiles would still appear at their old coordinates by adding a clear() method to the start of the loadWorldFile() routine.

- Encountered an issue whereby even when cancelling the moves edit form or deleting a tile and reopening it, the moves\_dict still persists in memory
-  This was resolved by using deepcopys of sub-dicts for child forms, since Python is screwy in that what it calls variables are actually just funky pointers.

- As thought, resuing a tile name completely deletes the initial tile. Added an error message in mainForm that also renames the new tile to a temporary random string for the user to manually rename (IF the coordinates between the two tiles differ)

## Design Refinements
- Added delete tile button to mainMenu form

## Learning
- - Had to relearn methods for json library in python, haven't used since last year. json.dumps() and json.loads() and file access pointers
- - Learnt how to manipulate tables in pyqt5 for world-map-loading
