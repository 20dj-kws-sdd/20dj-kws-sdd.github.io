## Progress:
This week I revised and worked on system modelling including context diagrams and the data flow diagram for the desktop application.

## Problems
I didn't encounter any issues this week, it was pretty smooth sailing.

## Learning
I revised in-class and and off the preliminary textbook the graphical system modelling tools like context diagrams and data flow diagrams, which seem like more simplistic versions of non-deterministic finite state automata. I was pleased to find out Dia ran natively on my GNU/Linux machine, and was even more pleased to find out that Dia itself is a part of the GNU project! It turns out Dia is Free Software (in the sense of freedom, not price) and is licensed under version 3 or later of the GPL.

## Refinements
While working out the system modelling tools I decided the application should have a definitive 'save' feature which would do more than write a JSON file to disk. This could be a commit to a local git repository but I'm undecided. I have also decided to integrate the game-playing command line application with the game-designing desktop application, which will run in another form. These are all shown as processes in the data flow diagram.
