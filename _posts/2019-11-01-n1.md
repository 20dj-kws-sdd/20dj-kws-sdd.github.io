## Progress
Progress so far has consisted of initial setup of the project, including creation of scaffold for the project portfolio, creation of initial gantt chart and formation of project ideas.

## Problems
I had to locate and incorporate a suitable title page for my portfolio being typeset in LaTex, eventually finding the "Vertical Line Title Page" template from www.latextemplates.com

I used the LibreOffice suite to create my gantt chart due to my operating system's inability to natively run Microsoft Excel.

## Learning
Learned a few new LaTeX commands from looking at the portfolio document template and title page, like `\raggedlength` and `\textwidth`.

## Screenshots/Evidence
