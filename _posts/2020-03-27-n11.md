## Progress:
School shut down last week due to Covid-19 and didn't begin online lessons until this week. I feel as if were I in any stage of my schooling life this would be a great joy, but the fact I'm doing my HSC this year leaves me with some quite mixed feelings. Nevertheless, this was the week of submission for the Planning and Designing component of the major task, and of course brought with it a mad rush. During the last two weeks I managed to:
- Update my Context Diagram
- Update my Data Flow Diagram
- Expand significantly upon my Data Dictionary
- Create my UI design mockups and the Storyboard connecting them
- Expand significantly upon my IPO Chart
- Refined my problem statement
- Wrote the section on development approach
- Wrote the section on System Documentation justification
- Expand significantly upon my social and ethical issues discussion
- Manage to publish a few of my blogs.

## Problems and Learning
Crunch time is never particularly enjoyable, but by far the worst part of this week was attempting to get the blog site running in the final few minutes before project submission. Having to install Ruby with all its cruft and a handful of broken Gems with arcane error messages as a last-ditch resort after attempting to convert markdown to html manually was a particularly educational experience, yet I managed to get the website up and running on GitHub pages a mere few minutes after the project deadline submission.

There were no particular issues with the project work itself I undertook, aside from the fact that is is extremely time consuming and labourious. Creating the UI mockups however gave me a greater understanding of I intend my project to look and the nature of its individual components.
