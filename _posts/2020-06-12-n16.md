## Progress:
This week I completed (what a I thought was) the construction of and the naming of all the elements in all the forms for the project. I also managed to disabled editing on the game-world grid by removing edit its edit triggers as well. Additionally, I reorganized the folders and layout of the project directory to a more readable alternative, with a UI\_Layouts directory for all the UI files.`


I also added multi-form functionality to the program by performing 'import' on form classes, then assigning them to within the parent form objects and using show() method.

## Problems
Fixed issue of non-adjusting-size widgets by reassigning all sub-widgets to the central widget with defined layout, adding margins as needed.

## Design Refinements
I realized that since each room type has significantly varying parameters, I'll have to construct a different editTile form for each room type and have the user select the room type for new rooms from the main menu. As a consequence of this I will have to add a "create room" button.

However, I could have the "edit tile" button change text to create room if the highlighted tile isn't created in the game world yet.
