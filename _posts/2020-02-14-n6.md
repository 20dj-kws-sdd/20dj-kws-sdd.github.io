##Progress:
This week I worked on further system modelling, including the structure chart and system flowchart.

##Problems
I didn't manage to finish the structure chart this week, the parameters were left incomplete. I'm not sure how to complete the system flowchart while representing the loop of event-driven user choice branching the main form.

##Learning
I worked on system modelling HSC exam questions during class for revision and to refine my understanding. I learnt a bit about execution stacks in lower level system programming, since structure charts seem to be a kind of visualisation of an execution stack over time.
