##Progress:
Similarly to the last update, this week was on the border of a term and having school start on a Wednesday means relatively little progress was made. The progress I did make was a rough start on the IPO chart.

##Problems
It's somewhat difficult to make an IPO chart for an application you haven't developed yet, but I've attempted to imagine the inputs the user would make and how the application would respond in the general sense. I feel that I won't know exactly what the inputs and processes are until I've completed developing the application, however I'm going to have to work through this as the documentation is due before the code.

##Learning
Over the holidays I came across a great source of programming/IT PDFs and ebooks, so this week I've been reading through "Rapid GUI Programming with Python and Qt" by Mark Summerfield this week. At the start of the project I wasn't aware of PyQt, a Python 2/3 binding of Qt that would allow me to develop the application without having to learn C++, only costing a minor hit to performance. I know that one of my favourite desktop applications, Qutebrowser, is written in PyQt.

##Refinements
I might decide to implement the project with Python3 and PyQt rather than C++ and bare Qt.
