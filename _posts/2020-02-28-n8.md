## Progress:
This week we mostly covered theory content relating to insertion, bubble, and selection sorting. We performed multiple exam questions during class and I got working on my data dictionary. I got started on an implementation of the sorting algorithms in C.
## Problems
Didn't encounter many problems this week, as were were mostly conducting theory work. I found it quite difficult to remember exactly which name referred to which algorithm, though.
# Learning
The specifics of Insertion and Selection Sort were somewhat new to me, but it was entertaining to derive the time complexity for both of them by hand.

As one may say, I didn't get so far in the specifics of the algorithm implementation this week.
