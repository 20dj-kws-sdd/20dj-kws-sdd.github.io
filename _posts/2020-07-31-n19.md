## Progress:

During the past week I have made the following progress:
- Finished dia diagrams and psuedocode.
- Wrote user manual pdf with LaTeX
- Added online input to forms, had to split manual with `standalone` latex module so each form could have an individual .tex file and pdf which are then compiled into the main user manual
- Completed "Testing and Maintaining the Solution" section
- Checked through blogs and made corrections where necessary.

## Problems

Resolved issue of being unable to create new terminal for game on windows by using "start /wait" command (from "https://stackoverflow.com/a/11615580")
- Tested this successfully on school computer

Encountered issue of program only being able to be ran in tbrpggepp directory due to usage of relative paths in program.
- Resolved by pre-appending every use of a relative path with "os.path.normcase(os.path.dirname(os.path.realpath(__file__)))" which returns the directory of the file being ran in normal case (ie. forward slashes rather than backslashes, identical between Linux and Windows)

Found an issue where the bubbleSort returns None if given an empty dict form, crashing the program
- Resolved by adding an if statement in bubblesort that automatically returns and empty list if given one
- - Also could've been solved by adding a "return iterable" at the very end of the method after the main loop but that would have been less clear of a solution

Found an issue where an if statement catching if the user was at the origin at editMovesTile (so the combobox could remove negative coord deltas) didn't work
- Figured out that checking if the user was at the origin via the coords tile\_dict value was shoddy, since if a new tile was being created the coords list was empty.
- Resolved by changing the method of determing if the user was at the origin in editTileForm by grabbing the values from the coord value user input fields and passing the results of that to editMovesForm instead.

Resolved mutltiple minor bugs including the editItem form opening with quantity=0 even if it was 1, this was because I set the default value to be 1 in the init form and if it was one it would skip the statement setting the input field to the passed quantity. Resolved by setting the default value to 0.

## Design Requirements
- Added tutorial.json game-world file to project directory, as an example for the user to edit off of.

## Learning
I learnt about all the dirname, realpath, normcase methods for the os.path library and the method of spawning new terminals in windows.
